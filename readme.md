## Facial Expression Recognition

### Overview
This project aims to build a real-time facial expression recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV. The model is trained to classify seven different emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.

## Files
cnn.py: Contains the code for defining, compiling, and training the CNN model.
app.py: A script to perform real-time emotion recognition using a webcam.
